Unreleased:
-----------

v0.10.2:
--------

This is a maintenance release that fixes compatibility with django-filter.

* 189 Fix method name collision


v0.10.1:
--------

This is a maintenance release that fixes the following bugs:

* #172 Prevent deepcopying of filter's parent


v0.10.0:
--------

This release primarily adds compatibility with django-filter 1.0 (more details
in #144), and is an intermediate step to overhauling the behavior of filters
that span relationships.

As `RelatedFilter` is a subclass of `ModelChoiceFilter`, you may take advantage
of the `callable` behavior for the `queryset` argument. The `queryset` is now a
required argument, which is a forwards-incompatible change. You can provide the
model's default queryset to maintain the current behavior, or a callable, which
will allow you to filter the queryset by the request's properties.

* #124 Removed deprecation warnings
* #128 Fix all lookups handling for related fields
* #129 Fix template rendering
* #139 Fix metaclass inheritance bug
* #146 Make `RelatedFilter.queryset` a required argument
* #154 Add python 3.6 support
* #161 Fix request-based filtering
* #170 Improve RelatedFilter queryset error message

v0.9.0:
-------

This release is tied to the 0.15.0 update of django-filter, and is in preparation of

next release.

v0.8.0:
-------
